# Legacy
The things I made before Sep 2016. I didn't know GitHub and many source codes and binaries are lost. This is all I can find now.

## Table of Contents
### HMCEditor
This was an IOS app that aimed to edit Minecraft PE save files but it didn't work at all as long as I remembered.

### IOS
#### BMI Calculator
This was probably one of first IOS apps. I remember I made a MD5 app as well.

#### Equation Calculator
Only the logo was left but I remember that it was working and can solve equations.

#### Flappy HQ
