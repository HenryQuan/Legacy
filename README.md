# Legacy
The things I made before Sep 2016. I didn't know GitHub and many source codes and binaries are lost. This is all I can find now.

## HMCEditor
This was an IOS app that aimed to edit Minecraft PE save files but it didn't work at all as long as I remembered.

## IOS
### BMI Calculator
This was probably one of first IOS apps. I remember I made a MD5 app as well. My friend helped me translating it into Vietnamese. Sadly, we are not contacting anymore. I wonder if he still remembers this.

### Equation Calculator
Only the logo was left but I remember that it was working and can solve equations.

### Flappy HQ
This was a Flappy Bird clone powered by cocos2d. It was really popular. I wonder if you can still run it though.

### HenryBird
It was a tutorial? I cannot remember. It still looks fancy.

## Minecraft windows programs
Entity, ID and Save were three different VC++ programs for editing Minecraft PE save files. I think it worked but not really good.

## SuuBird
It is a cross-platform version of [SuuBird](https://github.com/0xsuu/SuuBird) powered by cocos2dx. I think this was a birthday present for 0xSuu.

## Theos hacks
Some games that were hacked by me. This is a just tiny bit. I remembered I hacked way more than this. The first one was Plant vs. Zombies. I still like PvZ. I was so happy at that time. I was mainly using GDB debugger and disassembly tools to change the hex code of the armv6/v7 binary. Later, I knew Theos and started making tweaks.
Nowadays, people don't jailbreak anymore and I have moved to Android. I was such an Apple fanboy before and Apple was really the best but not anymore.

## Tweaks
### Beat master (乐动达人)
This was a music game that I used to play back then. This tweak unlocks all songs. I think it could also give you perfect beat all the time even if it is bad, good or very good. I don't know if you can still play it now.

### ischedulercr
I think this was a really good plugin for scheduled power off/on your iPhone. You know many phones still don't have this feature nowadays.

### Kugou music unlock
Kugou music is a Chinese music app. This removed region lock (you had to be in China to listen some songs). They check you phone number, your ISP and your location.

### mcpemod
This was my first [GitHub repo](https://github.com/HenryQuan/MCPEMods) and my best tweak ever made.

### pad hack
This was a hack for the Game, Puzzle and Dragons. I still play this game now. It has been more than 1500 days.

### pudding unlock
No idea what this was.

### [Retry](https://www.metacritic.com/game/ios/retry)
This was a good game back then. Since the creation of Fluppy Bird, people started making simple but good games that can be played over and over again.
